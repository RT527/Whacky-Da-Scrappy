Whacky-Da-Scrappy - I chose to make this game because I was reading a comic book about Scooby Doo in a apocalyptic world, and in it there was a character named Scrappy Doo. Scrappy is always trying to hurt Scooby-do and the human race, therefore I felt the need to make a game to express my frustrations with him and to have a little bit of fun. I also do a really good scooby-impression and wanted to include that in a game. 
Whack any character to get points! But if you whack scooby you will get negative points
