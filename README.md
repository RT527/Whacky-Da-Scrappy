Whacky-Da-Scrappy - I chose to make this game because I was reading a comic book about Scooby Doo in a apocalyptic world, and in it there was a character named Scrappy. I really don't like Scrappy so for many reasons I made this game to express my frustration and have a bit of fun. 
Whack any character to get points! But if you whack scooby you will get negative points
