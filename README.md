# Whacky-Da-Scrappy
A Scooby-Doo themed "whack-a-mole" game that includes:
* Scooby-Doo
* Scrappy-Doo
* Dracula 
* Sea Monster 
* And the Headless Horseman!

I was inspired to create this game while reading a comic book about Scooby Doo in an apocalyptic world. In the story, there was a character named Scrappy, who I have always found to be quite frustrating. Therefore, I decided to make this game as a form of lighthearted expression and to have some fun with it.

## Getting Started üïπÔ∏è
Whack any character to get points! But if you whack Scooby-doo you will get negative points.
